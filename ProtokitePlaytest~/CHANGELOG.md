## [1.42.0]

### Added
- **The Protokite Playtest package.** Install it with one click from Flock's Playtesting tab, from the release page, or
  with Package Manager. It needs Unity 2021.3 or later and the Flock SDK at the same version.
- **Playtest settings** at `Assets/Resources/ProtokitePlaytestSettings.asset`, created by **Protokite > Playtest >
  Settings**. Playtesting is **off** until a studio switches it on, and the Protokite API URL is filled in.
- **`ProtokitePlaytest.Status`**: whether the playtest can run, and what stops it if not. It follows the Flock SDK
  starting and stopping.
