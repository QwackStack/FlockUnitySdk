# Shop

[← Back to README](../README.md)

```csharp
var shops = await FlockClient.Instance.Shop.GetAllAsync(page: 1, limit: 10);
var shop = await FlockClient.Instance.Shop.GetByIdAsync("shop-id");
var item = await FlockClient.Instance.Shop.GetItemAsync("shop-item-id");
var items = await FlockClient.Instance.Shop.GetItemsByShopAsync("shop-id");
// Same retry contract as AddGameFunds (money mutation) — ambiguous failures throw; catch them.
// On throw, a Failed analytics event is recorded automatically. Catch FlockException and check
// e.Code for specific reasons (e.g. FlockErrorCode.ShopInsufficientFunds, ShopWalletNotFound).
// playerId is optional — omit it to use the signed-in player (CurrentPlayerId).
PurchaseResult purchase = await FlockClient.Instance.Shop.PurchaseAsync("shop-item-id");
var playerItems = await FlockClient.Instance.Shop.GetPlayerInventoryAsync();
```

## Rewards

Some shop items grant something the moment they are bought; others land in the inventory and grant when
consumed. Both paths report what was handed out, so you can show the player their reward without a
follow-up read.

```csharp
PurchaseResult purchase = await FlockClient.Instance.Shop.PurchaseAsync("shop-item-id");
foreach (ShopItemReward reward in purchase.Granted)
    Debug.Log($"+{reward.Amount} {reward.Code}");

// The inventory row moved under .Inventory; the wallet after the grant rides along when currency moved.
PlayerInventory row = purchase.Inventory;
PlayerData wallet = purchase.Wallet;

// Consume an owned item to collect its rewards.
ConsumeResult consumed = await FlockClient.Instance.Shop.ConsumeAsync(row.Id);
foreach (ShopItemReward reward in consumed.Granted)
    Debug.Log($"+{reward.Amount} {reward.Code}");

// What an item will grant, before buying it.
ShopItem item = await FlockClient.Instance.Shop.GetItemAsync("shop-item-id");
foreach (ShopItemReward reward in item.Rewards)
    Debug.Log($"advertises +{reward.Amount} {reward.Code}");
```

`Granted` and `Rewards` are never null — an item that grants nothing yields an empty list. `reward.Type`
is a string compared against `ShopItemRewardTypes.Currency` rather than an enum: rewards are stored as
typed entries so new kinds can appear without a schema migration, and an unknown value must not break
deserialization.

`ConsumeAsync` moves currency, so it carries the same money safety as a purchase — an ambiguous failure
throws rather than being re-sent, and only provably-unprocessed failures (408/429) retry. Catch
`FlockException` around it.

> Inventory is deliberately **never offline-cached** — it changes on every purchase, so the SDK always
> reads it fresh and there is no stale copy to fall back on when the network is down. Reading it offline
> throws `FlockNetworkException`.
